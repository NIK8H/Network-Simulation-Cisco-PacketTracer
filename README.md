# Network-Simulation-Cisco-PacketTracer
This project demonstrates setting up Ethernet‚Äë or Serial‚Äëlinked routers/switches, subnet segmentation for site‚Äëto‚Äësite connectivity, static routing, and Local / Site‚Äëto‚ÄëSite traffic testing (ping, traceroute), illustrating inter‚Äëoffice and intra‚Äëoffice network functionality.
# Corporate-Remote-Network-Simulation

A Cisco Packet Tracer simulation connecting a corporate office with three remote offices.  
This repo includes topology files, documentation, and testing procedures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

- **Corporate office**  
  - 1 √ó PC  
  - 1 √ó Switch/Router gateway

- **3 Remote offices**  
  - Each with 1 √ó PC  
  - Each with its own Switch/Router

---

## üåê Topology Details

1. **Corporate ‚Üî Remote connections**  
   - The corporate switch/router links to each remote switch/router via dedicated interfaces.  
   - You can choose Ethernet or Serial (mirroring Cisco Packet Tracer examples).

2. **Subnet Scheme**  
   - **Corporate ‚Üî Remote links:** Unique subnet per link (e.g. 10.0.1.0/30, 10.0.2.0/30, etc.)  
   - **Internal LANs:**  
     - Corporate LAN: 192.168.0.0/24  
     - Remote 1 LAN: 192.168.1.0/24  
     - Remote 2 LAN: 192.168.2.0/24  
     - Remote 3 LAN: 192.168.3.0/24  

3. **Routing**  
   - Static routes on corporate router to reach each remote LAN via appropriate interface  
   - Static routes on remote routers to reach corp LAN and other remotes via corporate router

## üíª Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Corporate-Remote-Network-Simulation.pkt` | Cisco Packet Tracer topology file |
| `README.md` | This documentation |
| `subnet_plan.txt` | Subnet allocations and addressing details |
| `traffic_test_results.txt` | Results and observations from traffic tests |

## üß™ Traffic Testing & Observations

To validate connectivity:

1. **Local LAN pings**  
   - From each PC to its router and back (e.g. PC1 ‚Üí Remote1 Router ‚Üí PC1)

2. **Site-to-Site pings**  
   - PC at Corporate ‚Üî PC at each Remote  
   - PC at one Remote ‚Üî PC at another Remote

3. **Traceroute**  
   - Verify path hops go through corporate router as appropriate

4. **Interface monitoring**  
   - Observed interface counters and link status to confirm traffic flow

Document these in `traffic_test_results.txt` with:
- Command outputs (`ping`, `traceroute`, `show ip route`)
- Observations (e.g. latency, hop counts, success rates)
